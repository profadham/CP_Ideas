trick:

assume I have k-1 indices i1, i2, i3, .... ik-1

I want to add ik and calculate its contribution to the answer

(assuming ik is added from right):
contribution    = (ik-i1) + (ik-i2) + (ik-i3) + .. + (ik-ik-1)
                = ik*(k-1) - (i1+i2+i3+....+ik-1)

storing prefix sum of indices and number of occurences of the element will help directly
compute the contribution of the new added element
