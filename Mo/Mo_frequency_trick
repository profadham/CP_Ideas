the trick:

assume I have a set and I add numbers to the set by Mo

I want to know in o(1) the number of elements having frequency at least k

NAIVE SOLUTION:
    one may think of having a frequency array and frequency array of the freq array and constructing a segment tree on it.
    however this may tle

NICE SOLUTION:
    let the frequency array called f
    and the freq of freq called ff
    normal add and erase functions will look like:
    add(x){
        ff[f[x]]--;
        f[x]++;
        ff[f[x]]++;
    }
    remove(x){
        ff[f[x]]--;
        f[x]--;
        ff[f[x]]++;
    }

    however if we changed them to look like:
    add(x){
        f[x]++;
        ff[f[x]]++;
    }
    remove(x){
        ff[f[x]]--;
        f[x]--;
    }

    the answer will just be ff[f[k]]. 
    when adding do not erase the old frequency 
    when deleting do not add the new frequency as it was already found
