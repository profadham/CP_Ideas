## given array a find its prefix sum array by convoluting it with an array of the same size full of ones

## why?

## because each index will correspond to itself and all after it when performing the multiplication

## now say we want to find the kth prefix sum array 

## what do I mean

## For example,

If  a0 = {1, 2, 1, 3}

a1  = {1, 3, 4, 7}
    
a2 = {1, 4, 8, 15}

a3 = {1, 5, 13, 28}
