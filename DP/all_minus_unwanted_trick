assume I want to compute the following dp formula

dp[i][n] = sum (dp[j][n-1]) for all j != i

this can be done by storing the sum of the values of the dp at each n value. let tot[n] represent sum (dp[i][n])
then if I want to compute dp[i][n] it is equal to tot[n-1]-dp[i][n-1]

this can be applied to anything that have inverse like xor for example.
